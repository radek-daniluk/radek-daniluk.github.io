### <a name="me_and_career"></a>About me and my career aspirations

I like programming and currently I am looking for a job involving software development, but I do not reject other positions definitively, because life can positively surprise.

By academic and [hobby projects](#projects) I practised writing code in languages like: C, C++, Java SE, HTML, CSS and different scripting languages. I also have experience with revision control systems, e.g. git.

Broad programming interest causes that I do not have a preference to code in a specific language. However, I want to work in a team, who quickly teach me good programming practices and modern methods of code creation and maintenance.

I am meticulous and I like to go into details of an issue. I am capable of investigating protocols to the last bit. I love to teach new things and expand my knowledge. I do not like monotony so I enjoy automating work.

I have practical knowledge of teleinformatic and telecommunication networks. My commercial experience inculdes core and radio access of cellular networks (SS7, GSM, UMTS, LTE) and TCP/IP. I also studied on my own IEEE 802.11.

I am Linux fan, because I like to know what is going on inside my hardware. I have practical knowledge of Ubuntu, Debian, ArchLinux and OpenWRT.

I can ephatize with people and I can explain technical issues to non technical staff in simple words.

If it would be required I could gladly widen my basic knowledge in field of electronics, energy industry or civil engineering.

I am also trying to become better person and value friendly people with good sense of humor.

Currently I am developing my smallholding in Sarniak village in lubelskie voivodeship, so I prefer to start working in this voivoidship, but as I mentioned, life can positively surprise. :)

## <a name="about"></a>About me and my interests

I like programming and currently I am looking for a job involving **software development**. By academic and [hobby projects](<{{ site.projects_url }}>) I practised writing code in languages like: **C**, **C++**, **Java SE**, **HTML**, **CSS** and different **scripting languages**. At work I dealt with C++, Delphi and scripting languages. I also have knowledge of databases and **SQL** and experience with **revision control systems**. I know in practice **NetBeans** and Linux development tools: **vim**, **gcc**, **make**, **gdb**. I also know **valgrind** and **in-browser development tools**.

Broad programming interest causes that I do not have a preference to work with a specific technology or language. However, I want to effectively utilise **good programming practices** and **modern methods** of code creation and maintenance.

I am **meticulous** and I like to go into technical details. I prefer tasks demanding thorough approach. I love to **learn new things** and **expand my knowledge** in different fields. I do not like monotony so I enjoy automating work.

I have practical knowledge of **teleinformatic and telecommunication networks**. My commercial experience inculdes core and radio access of **cellular networks** (**SS7**, **GSM**, **UMTS**, **LTE**) and **TCP/IP**.

I am **Linux** fan and I have commercial experience as power user. At home I am using: Ubuntu, Debian, ArchLinux and OpenWRT.

I can emphatize with people and I can explain technical issues to non technical staff in simple words.

I am also trying to become better person and value friendly people with good sense of humor.
